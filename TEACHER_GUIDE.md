## 🎮 During Class

### Starting the Simulation

1. **Check Student Roster**
   - View: Teacher Dashboard → [Period Name] → Students
   - Verify all students have created civilizations
   - Note: Students can't take actions until simulation starts

2. **Start Simulation**
   - Click **"Start Simulation"** button
   - Timeline begins at 50,000 BCE
   - All students can now see their civilization stats

### Advancing the Timeline

Each turn follows this pattern:

1. **Click "Advance Timeline"**
   - Historical event displays on screen
   - Example: "4500 BCE: Agricultural Revolution"
   
2. **Read Event Aloud** (recommended)
   - Explain historical context
   - Point out affected regions
   - Discuss implications

3. **Growth Phase Happens Automatically**
   - All civilizations grow (houses, population)
   - Stats recalculate based on population
   - Students see updated stats instantly

4. **Action Phase (2-5 minutes)**
   - Students can now take actions:
     - Build structures (temples, walls, etc.)
     - Declare wars (after 670 BCE)
     - Form alliances (requires Diplomacy)
     - Found religions (after 1000 BCE)
   - Monitor actions in real-time on dashboard

5. **Repeat**: Advance → Explain → Actions → Repeat

### Special Events

#### Wonder Assignment (Years: 1300 BCE, 44 CE)
```
When prompted:
1. View top civilizations by Industry
2. Click civilization name to assign wonder
3. Effects apply immediately
   - Great Wall: +Defense
   - Pyramids: +Industry
   - Colossus: +Diplomacy
   etc.
```

#### War Declarations (After 670 BCE)
```
When students declare war:
1. Combat resolves automatically
2. Attacker Martial vs Defender (Martial + Defense)
3. Loser is conquered (eliminated from game)
4. Conquered students reassigned to winner's civ
5. Special message: "The chair has claimed another victim..."
```

#### Religion Founding (After 1000 BCE)
```
Students can found religions:
1. Name their religion
2. Choose 2-3 tenants (beliefs)
   - Monotheism, Polytheism, Divine Right, etc.
3. +5 Faith bonus
4. Can spread to allied civilizations
```

### Teacher Controls

#### Pause/Resume
- **Pause**: Students can't take actions (useful for discussions)
- **Resume**: Students can act again

#### Back Button
- **Go Back**: Undo last timeline advance
- **Warning**: Reverses all growth and actions from that turn
- **Confirmation Required**: Prevents accidental use

#### Overview Panel
- **Civilizations Tab**: See all stats sorted by population
- **Alliances Tab**: Visual network of who's allied
- **Wars Tab**: Combat history and results
- **Events Tab**: Log of all timeline events

## 📊 Monitoring Student Progress

### Dashboard Stats (Real-Time)
```
For each civilization you can see:
- Houses / Population / Capacity
- Martial / Defense (combat power)
- Culture / Faith / Science (development)
- Buildings owned
- Conquered status (✅ Active / ⚰️ Conquered)
```

### Warning Signs
- **Population at capacity**: Student needs to build or face stagnation
- **Low Industry**: Can't build structures
- **Low Martial/Defense**: Vulnerable to war
- **Isolated (no alliances)**: Strategic disadvantage

### Engagement Tips
- **Celebrate milestones**: First to found religion, first wonder, etc.
- **Narrate wars**: "Egypt attacks Greece! Martial 25 vs Defense 20..."
- **Ask questions**: "Why did Sparta focus on martial?"
- **Historical connections**: "Notice how Egypt gets industry from Nile farming?"

## 🎯 Recommended Pacing

### Full Simulation (10-12 class periods)
```
Day 1: Setup (20 min) + First 5 events (30 min)
Day 2-10: 2-3 events per class (50 min)
Day 11: Final battles and end-game discussion
Day 12: Victory analysis and historical reflection
```

### Compressed Version (5-6 class periods)
```
Day 1: Setup + Events 1-8 (rapid advancement)
Day 2-4: Key events only (12-20)
Day 5: Final events and conclusion
Day 6: Historical analysis
```

### Single-Day Workshop (90 minutes)
```
0-10 min: Quick setup (pre-registered students)
10-60 min: Rapid timeline (teacher narrates, students act)
60-80 min: Final wars and outcomes
80-90 min: Reflection and historical lessons
```

## 📚 Educational Integration

### Learning Objectives Alignment
- **Geography**: Identify ancient regions and their characteristics
- **History**: Sequence major events from 50,000 BCE to 362 CE
- **Cause & Effect**: Understand how events affected civilizations
- **Decision-Making**: Strategic resource allocation
- **Collaboration**: Alliance formation and diplomacy

### Discussion Questions (By Era)
**Paleolithic (50,000-8,500 BCE)**
- Why did early humans migrate slowly?
- What limited population growth?

**Agricultural Revolution (4,500 BCE)**
- Why did Egypt and Mesopotamia advance faster?
- What role did rivers play in civilization?

**Bronze Age (2,250-1,200 BCE)**
- Why was writing important for development?
- How did trade networks spread disease?

**Iron Age (1,000-670 BCE)**
- Why did iron replace bronze?
- What role did religion play in society?

**Classical Period (480-301 BCE)**
- Why could cities support more population?
- What made Greece and Persia powerful?

**Roman Era (270 BCE-362 CE)**
- Why did Rome dominate the Mediterranean?
- What factors led to empire decline?

### Assessment Ideas
1. **Civilization Journal**: Students document each turn
2. **Strategic Analysis**: Explain key decisions made
3. **Historical Essay**: Compare game to real history
4. **Data Analysis**: Graph population/stats over time
5. **Presentation**: Groups present their civilization's story

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Student can't log in"**
- ✅ Verify email spelling
- ✅ Check invite code (uppercase)
- ✅ Ensure period isn't archived
- ✅ Try password reset

**"Timeline won't advance"**
- ✅ Check if simulation is paused
- ✅ Verify you're at timeline limit (362 CE is final)
- ✅ Refresh page and try again

**"Student's civilization disappeared"**
- ✅ Check if they were conquered in war
- ✅ Conquered students see winner's stats
- ✅ This is intentional (part of game)

**"Stats don't make sense"**
- ✅ Growth phase recalculates all stats
- ✅ Events can modify stats (check event description)
- ✅ Traits double certain stats (Strength: 2× Martial)
- ✅ Buildings add bonuses (Temple: +2 Faith)

**"Game is too fast/slow"**
- ✅ Adjust pacing by time spent per event
- ✅ Use pause button for longer discussions
- ✅ Skip non-critical events if short on time

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Classroom Management
1. **Set expectations**: Explain game rules before starting
2. **Monitor screen**: Watch for inappropriate civilization names
3. **Encourage cooperation**: Alliances make game more interesting
4. **Celebrate creativity**: Reward strategic thinking
5. **Historical accuracy**: Correct misconceptions as they arise

### Maximizing Learning
1. **Pre-teach regions**: Show map of ancient world first
2. **Connect to curriculum**: Tie events to unit topics
3. **Use primary sources**: Show images of wonders, civilizations
4. **Invite comparisons**: "How is this different from real history?"
5. **Encourage reflection**: "What would you do differently?"

### Making It Fun
1. **Narrate dramatically**: "The gates of Troy shudder under assault!"
2. **Use sound effects**: Find YouTube clips for battles, disasters
3. **Student roles**: Appoint "historians" to record events
4. **Prizes**: Small rewards for first religion, last survivor, etc.
5. **Rivalry**: Encourage (friendly) competition between students

  30 > 25 → Egypt Wins!
```
